# My Reflective Portfolio
## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?
-	Systems are a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form part of a unified whole. 
-	There are three types of systems: Open System, Closed System, and Isolated System
-	The components of a system can share a flow of information or matter between them and (If crossing the system boundaries) to the outside world.
-	Complex adaptive systems: --> one common property of complex systems, is that they adapt (that means they change their behaviour to improve their chances of survival or success) via learning or evolution

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
-	We can measure complexity and able to visualise it on a system level. For instance, a static complexity is the simplicity and on a micro system level. Complexity is measures on the amount of information required to describe the system.
-	A social system --> a system involving human beings influences by norms and sources in the community through politics and history.

### What insights have I gained?
-	I have understood the common characteristics of systems. For instance, Systems have structure and behaviour
-	I have understood the different assignments and assessments tasks that will be conducted under this subject.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed? 
-	My weaknesses are the ability to use both Github and Python as I do not have a lot of experience with these programs.

### What were the challenges that I or my team faced?
-	Understanding the different types of complex systems
-	I have not used Jupyter before, so I will need to conduct more research into this program and understand how and when to use it. This will be very beneficial for my assignment.

### What would I do better next time?
-	I will ensure to read the pre-work and lecture slides prior to the tutorial
- Make a list of all the questions and topics i found difficult and ensure i query those areas with the tutor during the assigned session

## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?
- I have learnt about the different types of models that help us understand complex adaptative systems
- I have learnt about how these different models are used
- Through the use of models we are able test out theories

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
- I learnt about different models which i did not know about before

### What insights have I gained?
- The seven uses of models (Reason, explain, Design, Communicate, Act, Predict and Explore

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
- Having learnt such a new concept this week, i have been able to grasp the concept quite quickly and have been able to fully understand the uses of the models explored this week.

### What were the challenges that I or my team faced?
- This week our group had a discussion of our interests and what we choose as our a topic. Each individual started to conduct their own research. I personally found this difficult as the topic for the assignment is very broad and i found it hard to narrow down a few topics.

### What would I do better next time?
- Read through the pre-work slides and ensure that if i have any queries to ask the tutor and not be afraid.

## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
- I learnt about the different assumptions associated with each model that has been discussed in this group.
- The Rational Actor Model has the assumption that each person has a goal and purpose. The objective of this model is that people try to optimise the outcome.
- Behavioural models are based on ones thinking and self-perspectives

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
- Everything that i learnt this week is new to me. I had basic knowledge of behavioural models and the humans psychological beliefs an impact on the outcome but, i didn't know much more than that.

### What insights have I gained?
- People follow very basic rules. For example, in the Schelling model, people decided to move or stay depending purely on how many like-minded individuals lived around them.
- Part of the time the reason we model is to figure out how people behave, i.e. are they rule-based, rational or irrational?
- Rational behaviour is a really good benchmark but including behavioural biases will inform us of some of the differences. If the differences are big, then we can decide if we need to revise our model.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
- In order to make decisions without any unbiased personal opinions. It is quite difficult to conduct to a statement or understand the results of a model if one is not able to get rid of any biased opinions.

### What were the challenges that I or my team faced?
- Our group narrowed down our choices for the assignment down to Mental health issues and Presidential elections. We were able to come up with a lot of issues that are present both domestically and internationally but found it difficult to link models and solutions to the issues we noted down.

### What would I do better next time?
- Use UTS Library to conduct my research rather than google and forums.

## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
- System Dynamics models analyse systems with feedbacks and interdependencies. They are used to model ecologies and economies, supply chains and production processes. They improve our capacity to think through logical chains that include negative and positive feedbacks. A systems dynamics model consists of sources, sinks, stocks, flows, rates, and constants.
- Systems dynamics models can include both positive and negative feedbacks.
- Systems are defined by their interrelationships and their functionality or potential.
- Exponential growth describes the graph of any variable in that loop over time
- The predator-prey model, an ecological model that captures the relationship between the number of hares (the prey) and the number of foxes (the predator). 

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
- Every that i have noted above, I did not know before

### What insights have I gained?
- The insight that i gained is that all models that we have spoken about in this subject so far, have positives and negatives

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
- My strength is that i am able to understand the theory noted but i am not able to remove my bias perspective when discussing the uses of each model. I tend to make an observation of the model prior to understanding the positives and negatives of the model.

### What were the challenges that I or my team faced?
- The aim of our group this week was to finalise our topic. The group decided to choose Presidential elections. With presidential elections we will focus on the upcoming election in the America and draw connections to the Australian elections. We look at what Australia does well and vice versa. 

### What would I do better next time
- Try to maintain and open mind to each model and not be bias

## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?
- Aggregation can lead to counter-intuitive effects when properties emerge as a result of interactions. One issue with reductionist science is that when you study individual agents or particles they may behave one way in isolation, but when they are all interconnected we can observe some new phenomenon.
- Probability is the long-term chance that a certain outcome will occur from some random process. It basically tells you how often different kinds of events will happen.
- A random variable is a variable that is subject to random variations so that it can take on multiple different values, each with an associated probability.
- Probability distributions models assist you to calculate each outcome probability, the long-term average outcomes, and estimate the variability in the results of random variables, without the need to have all the actual outcomes of the random variables you’re interested in.
-The Central Limit Theorem is a simple and effective model for aggregation of decisions in groups of people. Each agent makes an independent decision and we will measure the choices made via a probability distribution, which we can use to make predictions about what will happen.

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
- Everything i have noted above

### What insights have I gained?
- In the past i have always linked Probability to coins tosses, card games and numbered balls. I never realised that probability is much larger and bigger than that and can be used in modelling and focusing on problem solving.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
- My weakness is statistics and understanding the outcomes and how it can be used. I will conduct more research in my own time to clearly understand this topic.

### What were the challenges that I or my team faced?
- This week our group has decided to link models that we can use for chosen subject. 
- Rational Actor Model – it is quite evident that the United States have a problem with increasing the number of voters for their Presidential elections. The rational actor model is defined by the rational choice theory. The rational choice theory talks about making decisions that that maximise personal advantage. This leads to the question of how to showcase that voting is a source of personal advantage for votes. This can be done by creating educational seminars advising of the benefits of voting. 
- System Dynamics Model- Provides holistic view of the entire system and what it is used for, as well as the relationships each component has to each other. This model looks at all system intricacies. There are interdependencies, feedbacks and delays.  
- Network Model-Relationships between political structures and resource access in various parts of the nation, and the policies put in place.  
- Signalling- voter's actions and body language on voting or other national events. Politicians expressions. 
- Agent-based model- Simulation of system to model society 
 
### What would I do better next time?
- I think i worked relatively well this week. I was on top of all the tasks that i wanted to complete and was happy that as a group we were able to finalise our models for our assignment.

## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?
- I learnt about path dependence, which is that all paths that are taken are linked and dependent on each path. Basically, path dependence is that the outcome probabilities depend upon the sequence of past outcomes. Note that the outcome is not necessarily path dependent but the probability of the outcome is path dependent.
- To describe path dependence a 'Urn model' can be used to distinguish between models that are path dependent and those that are 'phat' dependent. 
- There are many types of Urn models - Bernoulli, Polya process and balancing.
- Urn models focus strongly on probability and outcomes
- In a Markov process the long term equilibrium never depends on the previous events—history doesn’t play a role because the system always wants to converge to the same equilibrium.
- Random walk models are derived from flipping a coin, where each outcome (heads or tails) has a probability of 1/2. This concept can be used to create a binary random walk.

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
- Everything that i have noted above, is somthing i did not know before.
