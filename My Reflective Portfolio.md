# My Reflective Portfolio
## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?
-	Systems are a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form part of a unified whole. 
-	There are three types of systems: Open System, Closed System, and Isolated System
-	The components of a system can share a flow of information or matter between them and (If crossing the system boundaries) to the outside world.
-	Complex adaptive systems: --> one common property of complex systems, is that they adapt (that means they change their behaviour to improve their chances of survival or success) via learning or evolution

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
-	We can measure complexity and able to visualise it on a system level. For instance, a static complexity is the simplicity and on a micro system level. Complexity is measures on the amount of information required to describe the system.
-	A social system --> a system involving human beings influences by norms and sources in the community through politics and history.

### What insights have I gained?
-	I have understood the common characteristics of systems. For instance, Systems have structure and behaviour
-	I have understood the different assignments and assessments tasks that will be conducted under this subject.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed? 
-	My weaknesses are the ability to use both Github and Python as I do not have a lot of experience with these programs.

### What were the challenges that I or my team faced?
-	Understanding the different types of complex systems
-	I have not used Jupyter before, so I will need to conduct more research into this program and understand how and when to use it. This will be very beneficial for my assignment.

### What would I do better next time?
-	I will ensure to read the pre-work and lecture slides prior to the tutorial
- Make a list of all the questions and topics i found difficult and ensure i query those areas with the tutor during the assigned session
